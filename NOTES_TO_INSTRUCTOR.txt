Project went well

The features we currently have implemented is the ability to login, create and delete documents

The documents are saved in real time so the user does not have to worry about losing data

We were not able to fully implement sharing but much of the model and view is implemented so
adding it should not be too hard.

Every new user has 2 demo files
